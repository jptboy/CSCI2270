hunt
alone
were
better
pair
particularly
were
trying
bigger
game
also
littler
things
having
partner
lightened
load
could
even
make
arduous
task
filling
familys
table
enjoyable
had
been
struggling
along
own
six
months
when
first
ran
into
gale
woods
was
sunday
october
air
cool
pungent
dying
things
id
spent
morning
competing
squirrels

hanging
its
neck
thin
wire
foot
above
head
fifteen
yards
away

another
recognized
twitchup
snares
because

other
hungry
animals
id
been
trying
use
snares
summer
no
success
couldnt
help
dropping
sacks
examine
fingers
were
just
wire
above
rabbits
when
voice
rang
thats
dangerous
jumped
back
several
feet
gale
materialized
behind
tree
must
been
watching
whole
time
was
only
fourteen
cleared
six
feet

him
around
seam

was
hoping
spring
might
able
bring
down
some
bigger
game
gales
eyes
fastened
bow
can
see
handed
over
just
remember
stealings
punishable
death
was
first
time
ever
saw
him
smile
transformed
him
someone
menacing
someone
wished

took
several
months
before

our
secret
places
were
thick
wild
plums
turkeys
taught
snares
fishing
showed
him
plants
eat
eventually
gave
him
our
precious
bows
then
day
without
either
us
saying
became
team
dividing
work
spoils
making
sure
both
our
families
had
food
gale
gave
sense
securityldlacked
since
fathers
death
companionship
replaced
long
solitary
hours
woods
became
much
better
hunter
when
didnt
look
over
shoulder
constantly
when
someone
was
watching
back
turned
into
much
more
than
hunting
partner
became
confidante
someone
whom
could
share
thoughts
could
never
voice
inside
fence
exchange
trusted
being
woods
gale
sometimes
was
actually
happy
call
him
friend
last
year
its
seemed
too
casual
word
gale
is
pang
longing
shoots
through
chest
only
was
now
course
dont
want
dont
want
him
arena
where
hed
dead
few
days
just
just
miss
him
hate

then
hed
give
smile
id
return
without
hesitating
now
cant
help
comparing
gale
im
pretending
peeta
how
never
question
gales
motives
while
nothing
doubt
latters
its
fair
comparison
really
gale
were
thrown
together
mutual
need
survive
peeta
know
others
survival
means
our
own
death
how
sidestep
effies
knocking

reminding
theres
another
big
big
big
day
ahead
tomorrow
night
our
televised
interviews

last
bit
strategy
remember
haymitch
shrugs
peeta
has
asked
coached
separately
betrayal

foolishly
formed
has
been
severed
high
time
too
games
begin
two
days
trust
only
weakness
whatever
triggered
peetas
decision
—
suspect

when
break
open
insides
are

dont
recognize
these

perhaps
are
edible
im
guessing
is
some
evil
trick
part
gamemakers
even
plant
instructor
training
center
made
point
telling
us
avoid
berries
unless
were
100
percent
sure
werent
toxic
something
already
knew
im
thirsty
takes
reminder
give
strength
fling
them
away

besides
our

lets
try
these
glasses
pull
glasses
slip

rue
wasnt
kidding
can
see
everything

trees
skunk
strolling
through
bushes
good
fifty
feet
away
could
kill
here
had
mind
could
kill
anyone
wonder
else
got
pair
these
careers
two
pairs
theyve
got
everything
down
lake
rue
says
theyre
strong
were
strong
too
just
different
way
are
can
shoot
says
can
can
feed
yourself
can
ask
dont
need
those
supplies
rue
says
didnt
supplies
were
gone
how
long
last
mean
its
hunger
games
right
katniss
theyre
hungry
says
rue
no
theyre
thats
problem
agree
first
time
plan
plan
isnt
motivated
need
flight
evasion
offensive
plan
think
were
going
fix
rue
rue
has
decided
trust
wholeheartedly
know
because
soon
anthem
finishes
snuggles
against
falls
asleep
nor
any
misgivings
take
no
particular
precautions
shed
wanted
dead
had
was
disappear
tree
without
pointing
tracker
jacker
nest
needling
very
back
mind
is
obvious
both
us
cant
win
these
games
since
odds
are
still
against
either
us
surviving
manage
ignore
thought
besides
im
distracted
latest
idea
careers
supplies
somehow
rue
must
find
way
destroy
food
im
pretty
sure
feeding
themselves
tremendous
struggle
traditionally
career
tributes
strategy
is
hold
food
early
work
years
when
protected
well
—
year
pack
hideous
reptiles
destroyed
another
gamemakers
flood
washed
away
—
those
are
usually
years
tributes
other
districts
won
careers
been
better
red
growing
is
actually
disadvantage
because
dont
know
how
hungry
way
rue
im
too
exhausted
begin
any
detailed
plan
tonight
wounds
recovering
mind
still
bit
foggy
venom
warmth
rue
side
head
cradled
shoulder
given
sense
security
realize
first
time
how
very
lonely
ive
been
arena
how
comforting
presence
another
human
being
can
give
drowsiness
resolving
tomorrow
tables
turn
tomorrow
its
careers
watch
backs
boom
cannon
jolts
awake
skys
streaked
light
birds
already
chattering
rue
perches
branch
across
hands
cupping
something
wait
listening
more
shots
arent
any
think
was
cant
help
thinking
peeta
dont
know
could
been
any
others
says
rue
guess
well
know
tonight
whos
left
again
ask
boy
district
both
tributes
two
boy
three
thresh
peeta
says
rue
thats
eight
wait
boy
ten
bad
leg
makes
nine
theres
someone
else
neither
us
can
remember
is
wonder
how
last
died
says
rue
no
telling
its
good
us
death
should
hold
crowd
bit
maybe
well
time
something
before
gamemakers
decide
things
been
moving
too
slowly
whats
your
hands
breakfast
says
rue
holds
them
revealing
two
big
eggs
kind
are
those
ask
sure
theres
marshy
area
over
way
some
kind
waterbird
says
itd
nice
cook
them
neither
us
wants
risk
fire
guess
is
tribute
died
today
was
victim
careers
means
theyve
recovered
enough
back
games
each
suck
insides
egg
eat
rabbit
leg
some
berries
its
good
breakfast
anywhere
ready
pulling
pack
says
rue

careers
food
really
how
can
see
glint
excitement

no
idea
come
well

—
theres
no
